### Project

Project for Unit 4 - Required for successful completion of the Front End Nanodegree at Udacity.  The project is a web application that incorporates the Leaflet map API in order to create a restaurant guide of the greater New York City area complete with business information, customer reviews, and hours of operation.  The goal of the project was to take a starter design an incorporate aspects of responsive design, CSS grids, ARIA best practices, and implementation of a service worker that would cache page elements for users to view offline at a later time, or provide a seamless experience for users that might be encountering temporary moments of decreases network connectivity/bandwith.
